### Inside your Docker container:

One you've spun-up your docker container and opened your browser at `localhost:8787`, you're no longer in Mac or Windows, you're in Linux (one of the `Debian` flavours).  If this is your first time using Linux, congrats! :)

Your docker container will load into the R-studio IDE.

#### Download the data, etc

Run commands in Terminal tab:

```{r, eval=F}
cd ~;
.\first_time_setup;
```
